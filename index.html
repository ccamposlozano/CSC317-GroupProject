      <p class="hero-text">Climate change is a significant and lasting change in the statistical distribution of weather patterns over periods ranging from decades to millions of years. It is caused by human activities such as deforestation, industrialization, and the burning of fossil fuels, leading to an increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The consequences of climate change include rising global temperatures, melting ice caps, more frequent extreme weather events, and disruptions to ecosystems and agriculture.</p>

      <h2>About Climate Change</h2>
      <p>Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges of our time. It refers to significant and lasting changes in the statistical distribution of weather patterns over periods ranging from decades to millions of years. Human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes, have led to an increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, resulting in global warming and other adverse effects.</p>
      <p>The consequences of climate change are far-reaching and include rising global temperatures, melting ice caps, sea-level rise, more frequent and severe weather events, such as hurricanes, droughts, and floods, and disruptions to ecosystems and agriculture.</p>
      <p>Addressing climate change requires urgent action at the individual, community, national, and global levels. This includes reducing greenhouse gas emissions, transitioning to renewable energy sources, protecting and restoring ecosystems, and adapting to the changing climate.</p>
